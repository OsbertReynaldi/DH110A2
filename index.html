            <div class="col-xl-12 d-flex">
              <p><b>How I use it:</b> Google Calendar is my #1 tool in staying organized, wherein I segment my team most clearly and find myself actually following the schedule I set out most of the time. I would check the mobile/web application at least 5 times a day, with more use on the Google Calendar tab on my browser. I put all my tasks and input time-blocks for even things such as lunch and doing homework, which I have found to be an efficient way to organize my time. 
                </p>
                <br>
                <br>
              </div>
              <div class="col-xl-12 d-flex">
              <p><b>Strengths:</b> I like that there are several integrations that make planning very seamless, including the Zoom/Google Meets integration, the maps location function, and sending calendar invites that automatically adjust to the respective timezones to avoid confusion. They have also added other features to embed meeting notes and other cross-functional applications that blend into the Google Suite ecosystem, which is useful as I am also an avid user of Google Drive. I like the tasks feature that you can set to repeat a custom number of times, thus making it seamless for the user to set things such as a weekly goal, etc.
              </p>

              </div>
              <div class="col-xl-12 d-flex">
              <p><b>Pain Points:</b> The daily, weekly, monthly, and yearly views can be quite limiting in terms of how it fits in the screen (some events can get cut off, etc.), and cross-integration of multiple gmail accounts can lead to some discrepancies such as having to log-in from different devices several times. The zoom plug-in also only appears when you go to the calendar view of the gmail account connected to the Zoom account - it would reduce the number of steps if users were able to log-in to these web conference applications separately to integrate with other gmail calendars. 
              </p>

              </div>
              <div class="col-xl-12 d-flex">
              <p><b>Overall Review:</b> A really good product that has an edge in the context of the overall Google Suite ecosystem, and is able to sync to multiple devices. While there is a learning curve to get accustomed to all the features and buttons, GCal, given its large user base due to the integrations with Gmail, is a well-designed product available to target many users from different levels of technical expertise.

              <h3> <br>Forest App (Osbert)</h3>

            </div>
            <div class="col-xl-12 d-flex">
              <p><b>How I use it:</b>  Forest is a time-management and productivity tool that I use a lot. It encourages you to stay away from your phone and focus on your work or life. How it works is that whenever you want to focus, you plant a tree - which will grow in your specified amount of time. If you leave the app, the tree will die and might cause a visible withered tree in your collection. Essentially, it works as a timer for focus periods.
                <br>
              </div>
              <div class="col-xl-12 d-flex">
              <p><b>Strengths:</b> The app employs a lot of gamification to make the concept of time management and productivity incentivized. You can build a forest collection (your dead trees will be visible - looks ugly), plant trees together with friends so you focus together, and focusing gives you coins to buy different types of trees (pretty forest) and even plant real trees. It provides an interest in achieving a pleasant and philanthropic goal, instead of just an app that blocks other apps or prevents you from exiting. It also builds a sense of community where you are given the accountability of being responsible for your own trees and collection.
              </p>
              <br><br>
              </div>
              <div class="col-xl-12 d-flex">
              <p><b>Pain Points:</b> While using the app, you cannot use it to answer any urgent messages or check anything else hat you might need or is important without the tree withering. This causes frustration for some users, including me sometimes because we are not given the option to pause in our “productivity”. I have also noticed a lack of retention for users because once you plant a tree, it’s just there growing without there being any reminders or prompts for the user to keep focusing.
              </p>
              <br><br>
              </div>
              <div class="col-xl-12 d-flex">
              <p><b>Overall Review:</b> Overall, I think it is definitely one of the better designed time management apps out there. It does a great job in giving users a different take to time management; making it a pleasant and fun experience to be productive. The seamlessness of usability, and retention methods other than during focus time, including, achievements, social good and the gamification, gives it a real appeal to all types of users of all demographics.

              <h3> <br>Physical Calendar (Celeste)</h3>
            </div>
            <div class="col-xl-12 d-flex">
              <p><b>How I use it:</b>   I rely on a physical calendar, a traditional planner that I journal down to efficiently manage my time and tasks. The act of writing down my schedule and to-dos provides a tangible engagement that digital tools often lack. Each morning, I take a few minutes to update it, allowing me to set the tone for the day and stay organized. This method works due to its simplicity and gives me satisfaction from physically marking off completed tasks.
              </p>
                <br>
              </div>
              <div class="col-xl-12 d-flex">
              <p><b>Strengths:</b>  The tangible nature of jotting down plans offers a level of engagement that digital options don't provide. It grants a clear visual overview of my schedule, aiding effective planning and time allocation. Additionally, being able to personalize it using colors, stickers, and notes enhances its visual appeal and aids in distinguishing different activities.
              </p>

              </div>
              <div class="col-xl-12 d-flex">
              <p><b>Pain Points:</b>  They lack instant accessibility from anywhere; if forgotten or left behind, I lose immediate access to my schedule. Making changes or rescheduling requires manual adjustments, often leading to a cluttered appearance due to erasing or crossing out. Additionally, physical calendars lack automated reminders for tasks or events, necessitating the need to frequently check and remember upcoming commitments. As it is physical, it’s also an added baggage when I have to go places, in comparison to my phone that I can access anytime and will always have with me.

              </p>
              <br><br>
              </div>
              <div class="col-xl-12 d-flex">
              <p><b>Overall Review:</b> The physical calendar remains a reliable tool for those who appreciate the traditional approach to time management. It offers a personal touch and a sense of satisfaction through physically tracking tasks and events. However, its limitations in terms of accessibility, flexibility, and integrated reminders may pose challenges for students seeking a more dynamic and technologically integrated solution. There’s no such thing as notifications for physical calendars, so you have to hold yourself accountable in remembering the tasks you set out for yourself.
